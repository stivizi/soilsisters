  What is Eco Enzyme?

What is Eco Enzyme
<http://enzymesos.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/12/What-is-Eco-Enzyme.jpg>

WHAT IS ECO ENZYME?

*What is Dr. Ros’sGarbage Enzyme?*

Eco enzyme is a complex solution produced by fermentation of fresh
kitchen waste (fruit and vegetable dregs), sugar (brown sugar, jaggery
or molasses sugar) and water. It is dark brown and has a strong sweet
sour fermented scent. Eco enzyme is a multipurpose liquid and its
applications cover household, agriculture, animal husbandry etc. Eco
enzyme is developed by Dr. Rosukon from Thailand. Dr. Rosukon has been
actively involved in enzyme research for more than 30 years and she
encourages people to make eco enzyme at home to ease global warming.

Dr. Ros’s Garbage Enzyme is a complex organic substance of protein chain
and mineral saltand juvenile hormone.

*Why should us make Garbage Enzyme?*

Each time you use cleaning products made with chemicals, you are already
polluting the underground water, rivers and the surrounding eco-system.
Conventional cleaning products usually contain harmful chemicals such as
phosphate, nitrates, ammonia, chlorine etc. The accumulation effect of
these chemicals released from every households can cause significant
damage to the planet earth. Let eco-enzyme be your best household
helper: general cleaner, air purifier, insect repellent, laundry
cleaner, car care, organic fertiliser etc. It is easy to DIY at
negligible cost, free of harmful pollutants, effective, multipurpose…

Discover the miracle eco-enzyme. Care for the earth, starting from your
kitchen.

*Reduce Pollution*
Methane gas released from disposed garbage can trap 21 times more heat
than CO2, worsen the global warming condition.

*Save Money*
Turn kitchen waste to DIY multipurpose house-hold cleaners.

*Multiple Usage*
Natural household cleaner; air purifier; detergent; car care; fabric
softener; organic fertiliser, etc.

*Anti-Bacterial, Fungus and Virus*
Natural antiseptic for your home.

*Purify Underground Water*
Enzyme residues flow underground will eventually purify the river and
the sea.

*Purify Air*
Remove odour. atoxic air released from smoking, car exhaust, chemical
residues of household products, etc.

*Enzyme’s Function:*

  * · Resolve / decompose
  * · Transform / Change
  * · Compose / make up / combination
  * · Catalysis

*Green House Effect:*

Green House Effect is caused by green house gasses. Greenhouse gases are
like a blanket. If they are at the right thickness, the Earth won’t be
too hot or too cold. Many experts now think the way we burning fossil
fuel and adding chemicals to the atmosphere is causing the blanket to
become thicker. This makes Earth warmer, an effect knows as Global warming.

*What are Global Warming and the Effect?*

Global warming is referring to the increase in the average temperature
of the Earth’s in recent decades and the effects are projected to be
continued.

Via the greenhouse effect
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect>s and natural phenomena
such as solar variation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_variation>
combined withvolcanoes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano> have
probably show us a small warming effect ever since pre-industrial times
from 1950.

Climate models referenced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change>
(IPCC) project that global surface temperatures are likely to increase
by 1.1 to 6.4 °C (2.0 to 11.5 °F) between 1990 and 2100.

An increase in global temperatures is expected to cause other changes,
including sea level rise, increased intensity of extreme weather events,
and changes in the amount and pattern of precipitation rain fall. Other
effects include changes in agricultural yields, glacier retreat, species
extinctions and increases in the range of disease vectors.

The increasing frequency of summer heat waves in temperate zones,
typhoons, hurricanes and floods are signs of the changing weather and
climate patterns across the globe.

According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 77,000 deaths
are recorded annually in the Asia-Pacific region due to health problems
arising from global warming. Among the potential effects of global
warming would be the appearance of mosquitoes in areas where they were
previously absent, with the accompanying threat of malaria and dengue
fever. There is also the risk of reduced rainfall in some regions,
causing a shortage of fresh water, thus introducing the danger of
waterborne diseases.

*Newspaper News:NST 2007/05/03*

GLOBAL WARMING: Final warning… Will Malaysia be arid like Africa?

As global warming looms, many scientists are sounding the alarm. Some
are predicting doom. How will it affect Malaysians? Are we prepared for
it? MINDERJEET KAUR wades through the gloom to find out KUALA LUMPUR:
Heat waves, floods, costlier food, water shortages and more diseases.
Malaysians must prepare for these over the next 20 years.

Global warming could even turn Malaysia into an arid state akin
toAfrica’s parched states, according to a weather expert.

And no less a person than Natural Resources and Environment Minister
Datuk Seri Azmi Khalid says 1,200 sq km of coastline will be under water
if no measures are taken to tackle global warming.

The journal Environment and Urbanization, in its latest issue, quoted a
recent study which showed that more than two-thirds of the world’s large
cities were in areas vulnerable to global warming and rising sea levels.
Some 600 million people could be affected.

Malaysians are already feeling the effects of freak weather patterns and
now experts warn that by 2025, higher temperatures will cause prolonged
droughts and intense floods.

The impact is likely to reduce food supply, causing the prices of
vegetables, rice, seafood, fruits and meat to rise………..

2.4 Mr. Al Gore:

In one especially disquieting slide, we are told that “if half of
Greenland and half of the Antarctic polar ice region melt,” numerous big
cities around the world will be partially or almost fully submerged by
varying sea levels, including parts of Lower Manhattan, San Francisco,
Beijing, India, Bangladesh. In the last three places, “millions and
millions of people would die,” Mr. Al Gore cites, with millions more
taking on the status of displaced citizens.

2.5 Enzyme Anti Greenhouse effect

As the result in enzyme production, O_3 + NO_3 + CO_3 generated could
purify the cloud and becomes white color; due to reflection from the sea
the sky looks blue. But, instead dark cloud which accumulated a lot of
heavy metal become greenhouse effect and more heat are trapped on the
earth. The O_3 from Garbage Enzyme could reduce the heavy metal in the
cloud thus heat are released from the earth, that’s maintaining the
earth’s temperature and save the atmosphere and global.

If every household make enzyme, this would help in anti global warming
effectively.

*ECO Enzyme* is the solution to recover our ozone layer and lower the
global temperature. Discover the endless benefits of this Earth-Saving
enzyme you can make in your kitchen. It is rewarding to heal the Earth.

More NO_3 in the air can feed the plant. The plants will growth well.
The root can let the animal alive, and animal give their waste to the
plant more hormone and nutrition.

*For Agriculture*

Reduce over-use of chemicals in the agriculture. Keep the farm free from
infections and insects.

Enzyme can fertilize the soil for healthy vegetable growing.

It is natural hormone for plants and trees as well as natural herbicide
and Pesticide. Enzyme can also cultivate sandy land to fertile farm land
which is suitable for planting.

It also keeps the air in the farm atmosphere clean and cool, clean
impure and dirty water in the farm.

3. *For House Hold*

Regularly

  * Enzyme is a popular household cleanser, cleaning with enzyme is a
    smart way to avoid using harsh chemicals. By the end those Enzyme
    will reach to the river & the sea and it will safe our environment.
  * Remove the foul odor, mold and grime in kitchen and bathroom
  * Anti bacterial and virus
  * Help in driving away insects
  * Remove odor from pets and cigarettes
  * For ticks and carpets
  * For ironing and washing
  * For hallway and bedroom
  * For car maintenance

*ECO Enzyme* is a complex solution produced by fermentation of fresh
kitchen waste (fruit and vegetable dregs), brown sugar and water. It is
dark brown and has a strong sweet sour fermented scent. Garbage Enzyme
is a multipurpose liquid and its applications covers household,
agriculture, animal husbandry, etc.
*Change Climate
*From day one you start making Garbage Enzyme its catalyses process will
release ozone gas (O3). O3 can reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) in the
atmosphere and heavy metal that traps heat in the cloud. Hence heat can
be release from the Earth, reducing greenhouse and global warming effects.

Enzyme converts ammonia to nitrate (NO3), a natural hormone and nutrient
for plants. Meanwhile it converts CO2 to carbonate (CO3) which is
beneficial to sea plants and marine life.

Being a Sister isn't about gender or labels. The word Sister isn't meant to discourate anyone. It pays tribute to the associated connection around the feminine capacity to grow and nurture life. Everyone carries that capacity and anyone can become a Sister. We hope they do because soil building is one of the few things that anyone can do to save the species. And Soil Sisters is a great place to collaborate with people who share this truth.

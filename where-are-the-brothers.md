The word Sister isn't meant to discourage anyone. It transcends gender and labels, honoring instead the associated connection around the feminine capacity to grow and nurture life. Everyone carries that capacity and anyone can become a Sister. We really hope they do because soil building is one of the few things that anyone can do to save the species, and Soil Sisters is a great place to collaborate with people who share this truth.
